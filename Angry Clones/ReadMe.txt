IRON LUNG
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions
www.cumberlandgames.com

This font's sort of a hybrid, with elements of both a stressed font and an engraved font, with the end result standing in for crudely stamped letters from a plate of metal. It’s an all-caps* font with a full keyboard set and the usual extras I tend to toss in (a few fractions, smart-quotes, dashes and whatnot). Enjoy.
